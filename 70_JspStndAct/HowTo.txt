Here we are using the Jsp Standard Action:
<jsp:useBean id="" class="" scope="" />
<jsp:getProperty name="" property="" />

If you have any scoped attribute and the object is a proper bean.
then you can use the standard-action to access it instead of scripting.

This technique is developed to provide alternate ways to 
reduce the use of scripting.
