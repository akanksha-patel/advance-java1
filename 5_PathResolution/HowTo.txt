//The relative path configured in your links and forms are 
//converted into absolute paths by removing the last requested 
//resource(in last requested URL) with the relative path specified in href(<a>) or 
//action(<form>) attribute.

//If the last requested resource is:
	localhost:8080/MyApp/abc/mno.html
//And the relative link path in mno.html is kkr.html
//then the link path would be converted into absolute path:
	localhost:8080/MyApp/abc/kkr.html
