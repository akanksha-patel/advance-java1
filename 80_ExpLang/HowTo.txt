This example demonstrates that we can use dot operator
in EL syntex where the first part must resolve to a bean or a 
map. If it resolves a bean object then the second value after 
the dot operator is one of the property-name of the bean object
and one more thing the property name is resolved according the
getter method.
If the first part in the EL syntex is resolved to a map then the 
second value after the dot operator must be a key. The result in case of 
map is the value attached to specified key.
