Here we used the square brackets and shown you the alternative
way to access the same thing which was earlier accessed through the 
dot operator.

Don't forget to wrap the value in single quotes before you put it in the 
square brackets.

The square brackets allow you to use Map, Bean, Array and List.

If you use array or list then the argument in the square bracket is a number
and wrapping the number in the single quote is not mandetory.


Always remember that if you are using dot operator then the value after 
the dot operator must follow the rules for java identifiers. Means the value
after the dot operator can't start with digit, or it can;t be a keyword.

To surpass the problem we can use square brackets instead.
