init():

You are allowed to override the no-arg init method supplied by the 
GenericServlet. You are not allowed to override the init(conf) method.

It is init(conf) which calls our init(). By overriding the init() you can write 
any initialization code you want to run when the lifecycle moment init is 
triggered.

It is ok to call the getServletConfig() as the config is already created and 
supplied to the init(conf).


destroy():

You can override the life-cycle method destroy() to write code in your 
servlet which will run when the servlet is destroyed:

A servlet is destroyed when the containning application is stopped, destroyed or the 
server is shut-down.
