The jsp:useBean standard action is also used to set an attribute
in specified scope:

First of all it tries to locate the specified (id) attribute in the specified
scope. When it doesn't find one then creates a new object of the
specified class. And also saves it in the specified scope as an attribute 
with the same attribute name.(Please refer the translation)

Note: the bean class specified in the class attribute must have a no arg constructor.
