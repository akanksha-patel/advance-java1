If we have a reusable component in several responses 
then we extract that part from each reponse and create another 
servlet to handle that part. 

Now all other servlet from which we extracted the reusable content 
will include the extracted response servlet.

This way code duplication is reduced drastically
and code maintainence is simpler.
