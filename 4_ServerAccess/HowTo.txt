//If you configure a welcome file in the web.xml then 
//the default nature of your server(sending an index page)
//is overridden.

//If there are more than one welcome file in the welcome file list 
//then the server reads the welcome file in top down order until the 
//match found. Ones the match found the file will be returned as a 
//response.

//if no match found then 404 page not found response will be displayed on 
//client machine.
