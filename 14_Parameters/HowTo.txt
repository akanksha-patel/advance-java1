//Case 1:
When any checkbox, radio-button or drop-down-menu option
is ignored by the end user then there will be no parameter entry 
in your address bar as a query part.
On the other hand the text fields if ignored then they still become 
the part of your query-part.

//Case 2:
Whenever you create radio-button or checkbox then the user can't 
enter any typed value, instead he/she is just checks or unchecks the
options. It causes your parameter value to be set to 'on'. Which is 
meaningless to the server. So you must set value attribute in your 
checkbox and radio fields.
