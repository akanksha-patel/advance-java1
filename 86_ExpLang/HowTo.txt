The cookie EL implicit object is used to access client side cookies.
The  cookie EL impl.-obj. is a map and the cookie name becomes
key but cookie value does not become the value against the key
instead the entire cookie object is stored against the key. that is
why you need to use name and value properties of Cookie class to
access the cookie information.
