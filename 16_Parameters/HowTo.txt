If multiple selection is on in your drop down menu
then if you will not select any option then your address
bar will not reflect any entry for the field.
On the contrary the drop down menu if not enabled for 
multiple selection then the default displayed value will
be considered as user's selection.

We also tried the getParameterValues() method as a good choice foe
this case.
