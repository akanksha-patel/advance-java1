It is always too late to work on response side 
after the response is either flushed to the client
or dispatcher forwards the request to some 
other servlet.

If you do so the IllegalStateException will be thrown.
To recognize that event, you need to wrap such call 
inside the try-catch. 

Also keenly observe the stack trace of second servlet in our example, 
when such exception occurs. You can see that both the servlets are 
stacked up into the same thread and the thread starts with the run method.

All methods which can cause IllegalStateException are in 
the ServletResponse, HttpServletResponse & HttpSession API.
Please find them all.
