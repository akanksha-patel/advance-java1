It is not always that a getter method is cretaed for a bean property.
In our example the getAttribute() method is simply mistakenly understood
as there is an attribute property, buut there is not.

At the same time there are several other get methods have properties in the
PageContext object.

One more thing we should take care while accessing the EL:
When the frist part before the dot operator is resolved a bean then 
before using a property after the dot operator, make sure that there 
is a getter method.

Again when we say the page scope then the scope is limited to the page.
If an attribute saved in a page scope then it will destroy as soon as the 
page run competes.
