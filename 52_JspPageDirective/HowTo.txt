To write the import statements we use page directives.
<%@ page  import="" %>

You can write more than one import statements in a single directive:
<%@ page import="java.util.Date,model.Person"  %>

Or you can write them saperately:
<%@ page import="java.util.Date"  %>
<%@ page import="model.Person"  %>
