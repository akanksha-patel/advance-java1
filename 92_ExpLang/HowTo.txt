The EL handles the null value gracefully.

One thing we notice that the bean property must exist
or the page will crash. No problem if you access an 
existing property which is uninitialized.

There is one more point to be noticed that if we access 
a key in a map using EL and such key is unavailable then 
the EL handles it gracefully. The same behaviour is seen 
when we try to access an index of an array or list which is
not available(the index), the container simply does not show 
any thing at that point, instead of showing an error page 
with ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.

EL supports operators: 
When we write an expression 2/0, the EL handles it gracefully
instead of throwing an ArithmeticException and sending the 
crash report, the value infinity is displayed, no crash occurs.
While using modulo division you can't expect the same, means
you wont experience the graceful handling in this case.
