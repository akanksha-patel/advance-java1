Using the <%@ include %> directive you can create your own 
reusable page components. This reduces any redundency(duplicate code).

It allows us to make changes easily. You only need to make changes in 
included page once and the changes will reflect in each including page, 
instead of making changes in each page.

include directive is a translation time instruction. So any changes need to 
restart the application. The JEE spec. says it is a translation time instruction.
But the Apche Foundation implemented the directive to reflect changes without
restarting the application. On the next request server itself sences the changes
and again performs the translation.
