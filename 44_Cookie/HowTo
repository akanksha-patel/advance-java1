//Case 1:
When we create a Cookie object, by default the max-age is -1.

A negative value means the cookie will be deleted at client side 
as soon as we close the browser.

//Case 2:
If you set a positive value as the max-age of a cookie then the 
cookie will expire as soon as the time elapsed or expired. In this
case the expired cookies will not take part in subsequent request.

//Case 3:
If the max-age is set to 0 then the cookie will not be saved at all in the 
user browser. 

//In MozillaFirefox browse use menu-option > Tools > Page Info
Here you can get the cookies saved.
