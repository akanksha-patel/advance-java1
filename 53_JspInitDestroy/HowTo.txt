You can override JspPage API methods jspInit() and jspDestroy().

To do this you need to write the override code in declaration <%! %>.

Both are life cycle methods and called once in their life.
jspInit is called when jsp page is initialized and jspDestroy is called
when the application is stopped, destroyed or the server is closed.
