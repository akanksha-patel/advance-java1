jsp:setproperty says that if you want your form information to
save in a bean object then use the property name of the bean 
in the form field name. The setter standard action takes care of 
setting the value with minimal efforts... see the case 4 and 5.

In case 2 the problem was the user input in the form of parameter
is always considered string, but the property of the bean may be
int, float, date etc. then you further needed to parse before you 
set the information. But the case 4, 5 takes care of parsing the 
information as well.
