To dicourage stuffing html in servlet(java), the jsp techinique is evolved.

Creating a jsp page is very simple: 
Write a html page and save it with jsp extension.

Jsp is a complete responsibility of the Server.
If you access a jsp page server takes care of translating it into a servlet
and compiling it and rest of the life cycle is same as the servlet classe's.

When server recognizes an application deployed in the server then 
server creates a folder with same application name inside the work directory:

Tomcat 5.5 - > work -> Catalina -> <App-Folder>

When any jsp is accessed the very first time, then the server translates and 
compiles it in the same folder. The folder hierarchi is:

Tomcat 5.5 - > work -> Catalina -> <App-Folder> -> org -> apache -> jsp -> <translated-jsp-page>

Also see the documentation of the JSP-API and the jsp-api.jar.
