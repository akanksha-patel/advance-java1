In this example we learnt:

The type and class attribute in the jsp:useBean are optional,
but not both at the same time. Either you mention type or class.

You are only allowed to put a concrete class in the class attrib.

If you mention only type attrib then it will work fine as long as 
the specified attribute exists, otherwise it will trow an:
InstantiationException.
