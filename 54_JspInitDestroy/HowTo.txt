Jsp Implicit objects are not accessible from within the jspInit and jspDestroy.

The implicit objects are created inside the _jspService method and they are all
local variables of the methods, not accessible outside the _jspService().

You can still call getServletContext() and getServletConfig() from within the 
init and destroy methods as the translated jsp falls in the HttpJspBase class inheritance tree.
