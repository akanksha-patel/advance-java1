You can also set init parameter for jsp. 
To do this you need to provide servlet mapping just like we do it for
a servlet but instead of writting <servlet-class> we use <jsp-file> tag.

You must specify the jsp page's path with respect to the application root,
both in the <url-pattern> and <jsp-file> tag.

The servlet class created by us has it's own config and jsp file has it's own config.
So the init-param mapping for both of them needed to be done saperately.
