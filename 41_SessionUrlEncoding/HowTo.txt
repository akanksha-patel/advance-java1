response.encodeURL() helps to attach session-id to the url.
this way the encoded url helps to maintain the session, even though 
the cookie at client side is disabled.

the method is smart such that when the cookie is enabled, it just 
skip the encoding. In other words it only endoes the url when there
is no request header naming cookie.

It is request.getSession() method which is capable enough to 
read the cookie request header and if not found then it also checks 
if the url is encoded or not. If the cookie header is missing, then 
it checks for the url and if the url is encoded then it fetches the 
session-id and rest is the same, it finds the matching session object in the
session pool.

encodeURL works only when the cookie header is missing.
