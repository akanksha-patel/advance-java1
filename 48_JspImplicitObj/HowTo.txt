There are 9 implicit objects:

request	- HttpServletRequest
response	- HttpServletResponse

application	- ServletContext
config	- ServletConfig

session	- HttpSession

page		- Object
pageContext - PageContext
out		- JspWriter

exception	- Throwable

All these implicit variables are created & initialized in each Jsp Page.
In other words you neither need to call getSession(), getServletContext() etc..
nor you need to create your own variables to hold the session, config etc...

The exception implicit object is created when you write isErrorPage="true" 
in page directive.
