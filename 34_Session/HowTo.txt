The client establishes a connection with the server, and sends a request.
When the response is recevied the connection is closed by the client.

To track the client... server uses the session tracking mechanism. 
request.getSession() helps on both the sides :
1. on request side: the method checkes if the client request consists of 
cookie information with JSESSIONID: 
	if Not: then the method creates a session with unique id. and associates 
		client's request with the session.
	If Found: then the method just tracks the session, in other words does not 
		create new one. 
2. on response side: the method in all cases creates a cookie object and saves
the unique session id as a name value pair in the cookie. and sets the cookie into the 
response. 

The cookie is set with the response-header naming: set-cookie

The cookie is the information which is set in the client machine by the server, with the
intention to get back the same information with all subsequent request, either it is 
usefull or not at any point of time at the server end.
