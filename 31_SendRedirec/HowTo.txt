When we redirect the servlet actually wants to say that 
I am not going to give you the desired response, instead
I am sending you the url where you will get the actual
response.

The sendRedirect method of repsonse set a status code 301
to tell the browser the response i am sending is not the 
original response. I am sending another url to visit to, in 
response-header 'location'. The browser knows that, it is required to 
retype the location path in the address bar and send another request 
without involving the end-user at the client end.
