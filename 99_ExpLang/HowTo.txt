In this example we demonstrated the EL function:

Step 1:
To enable EL function you must write a class and supply a static method 
which will ultimately run in the background. Class and method must be public.

Step 2:
Next you need to write a .tld file and you need to put it beside the web.xml file.
The tld file must have a <uri> tag. Uri name specified in the uri tag will be used 
to reffer the tld file.

Step 3:
You must configure a <function> tag. Next you need to write 3 essential child
tags naming <name>, <function-class>, <function-signature>.

Step 4: To use this function from within a Jsp page you first need to write a 
taglib directive with some prefix and uri attribute. 

Step 5: 
Now you are ready to call. Suppose you abc is the prefix and conv is the function
name then:
${abc:conv()}
