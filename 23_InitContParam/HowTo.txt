Because Our Custom Sevlet IS-A Servlet as well as ServletConfig
Thus you can call the API methods of both interfaces directly from
within our servlet's doGet/doPost, like:

getInitParameter instead of getting the ServletConfig first then 
accessing the initParams through the ServletConfig object.

Same in the case of contParam:
You do not need to get the config object first then through the conf 
object get the context object then the contextParam associated.
You can instead say:
getServletContext() then using the context object you can get the 
contParam associated.
