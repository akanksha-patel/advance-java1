This example demonstrates how to access a servlet resource from 
different html pages specially when they are stored in different 
folders.

Anther aspect we have covered here is, how simple it is to move 
the servlet or rearrange their package, and the how the mapping 
saves you from making changes in all the html pages linking to that
servlet resource.
