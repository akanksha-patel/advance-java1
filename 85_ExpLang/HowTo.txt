The header EL implicit object reffers to the request headers not the 
response header. 

Header is the the map of request-headers where the header names 
become keys and the values against the keys are the header value.

One more thing when the header name is created with more than one
word then to access the header you must use [] symbol instead of dot.

There are no header with multiple values in our case thus not able to 
show the headerValues effectively.
